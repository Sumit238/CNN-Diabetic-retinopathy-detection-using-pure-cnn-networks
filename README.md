# Diabetic-retinopathy-using-Pure-CNN-networks
Hello,

In this project only pure CNN architectures are used for classification of DR(Diabetic retinopathy).  
Dataset used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) so you might need to create Account on kaggle to download dataset

**Note** : It is recommended to use [**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/)  (to run program files)  and  [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/) (to store dataset).
           However if you want to do it on **local machine** you will have to change file paths in respective places in all notebooks 


Step1-> run download_dataset.ipynb

Step2-> run rename_dataset.ipynb

step3-> run train_test_division.ipynb

step4-> run CnnTraining.ipynb

Thank you
